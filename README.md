# Counter & List App

A simple React-based application that allows users to:
- Increment/decrement a counter.
- Add numbers to a list.
- Sort the list in ascending or descending order.
- Highlight the highest and lowest numbers in the list.
- Reset the entire list.

This project demonstrates **React hooks** (`useState`), **component-based architecture**, and separation of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS logic**.
